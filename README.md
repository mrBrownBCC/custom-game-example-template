# Setup Instructions
In order to run the GUI:
Go to the ports tab. Click "Add port" and type the number 6080.
Follow the link to your forwarded address. This is where your GUI should be available once you run your code. Note that the GUI won't work very well until you have finished most of the code - tests will be used to make sure the intermediate steps works well. 

To access the code, go to app > src > main > java
